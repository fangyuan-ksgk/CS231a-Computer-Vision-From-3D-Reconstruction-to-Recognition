Assignment 2:

1. Fundamental Matrix Estimation From Point Correspondences (8-point algorithm & normalized 8-point algorithm), fundamental matrix can be computed with 8 corresponding points from two images obtained by two different camera (intrinsic & extrinsic matrix differs). We can use Fundamental Matrix to plot the Epipolar lines on both images, which can be used for image rectification.

Accuracy of the estimated Fundamental matrix can be evaluated by the average distance between points and their corresponding epipolar lines (in both images from two camera systems).
